### Agile Development  
- During the development of the Sun&Peaches fashion jewelry e-commerce project, I followed an Agile approach to manage the project effectively.
- The project's development workflow was organised through GitHub Projects and Issues.
- Most of the time I focused on user stories to quickly plan the project due to time constraints
- Later in the development, I switched to the MOSCOW system to prioritize tasks better. This categorization method helped me decide what aspects were crucial (Must-Have), important (Should-Have), optional (Could-Have), or not needed (Won't-Have).
- I also started using GitHub Issues labels to organize tasks effectively, making it easier to see importance and type.
- I continuously assessed and adjusted the project. This allowed me to make real time changes based on feedback and insights.
- By applying Agile methodologies, I managed to create a functional e-commerce platform for Sun&Peaches. But, there is room for improvement to fully aligns with the brand's identity and meets all user requirements.

## Design  

### Wireframes  
- The initial project wireframes. As they are created in the early planning stages, they will differ from the final project.  

  #### Desktop Wireframes

  ![Mobile Profile Page](static/images/wireframes/Mobile-Profile.png)    

### Database Schema  

### Colors  
- I selected these pastel colors that contribute to the overall visual appeal of the Sun&Peaches.
- I chose peach like color (#ff9c7f) because it looked playful and energitic and making it ideal for main heading.
- Light green (#8cada4) was chosen because it brings harmonious nature feel.
- Light brown (#bea494) allows the content and visuals to stand out while maintaining a calm ambiance.
- Dark brown (#4c413b), wekk this pastel color is legable and readable.
- They might initially appear distinct, but when combined, they create a harmonious appearance.   
  ![Color Pallete](static/images/readme/colors.png)

### Fonts  
- I chose [Quicksand Google Font](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Quicksand?query=quick) for its modern and clean appearance. This font's readability and simplicity enhance the user experience, making content easy to read and comprehend.    

  ![Quicksand Font](static/images/readme/quicksand.png)   
  
- For headings and important elements I chose [Laila Google Font](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Laila?query=laila), as its elegant and distinctive style emphasizes key sections of the Sun&Peaches e-commerce.   

  ![Laila Font](static/images/readme/laila.png)   

### Icons  
- Icons used on this website are from [SVG Repo](www.svgrepo.com)
- As Favicon and cursor I chose to use peach to create playful visual experience that aligns with the brand's identity.
- Peach cursor adds a touch of uniqueness to user interaction, enhancing the overall user experience.  
  ![Peach](static/images/readme/peach.png)

- For pointer cursor I opted for a sun to provide clear feedback to users when they hover over elements like buttons and links.  
  ![Sun](static/images/readme/sun.png)  

- In the future, I plan to introduce a feature that allows users to choose between custom cursors and the standard cursors used on websites.
- This customization option will provide users with the flexibility to select their preferred cursor style.
